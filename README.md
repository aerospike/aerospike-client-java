Aerospike Blob Finder Package
=============================

This package is designed exlusively to detect language specific blobs in an
Aerospike database. It uses specialized AerospikeClient code that appears
like a client, but does not behave like a client. Examples, benchmarks and 
test are disabled.

Build instructions:

    mvn clean
    mvn package

See [blobfinder](blobfinder/README.md) for example code to run the blob finder.
